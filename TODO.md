### What to do next







### Done!
* Fix the memory leak in the HighlightedComment Component
    * Currently it makes infinite calls to the database.
        * (I did't actually do anything. I guess the weird calls were just a bug being caused by the server. I just needed to run npm start again)
* Get the new comments to show in comments list. 
    * Currently you need to manually refresh to get the new comments to show
